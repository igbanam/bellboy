Title of the Change

Describe the change in as verbose a term as you can be. Make sure each line in
this block of text wraps at 72 characters; standard Git requirements. Before
merge, I'd require all changes be squashed into one commit. This message here
should be what is in that commit message. This helps tell a coherent story of
how the app was built.

This change addresses the need by:

* itemize all the steps
* you took to get this commit complete
* this list has no length limit
* enumerate to your heart's content
* also wrap this at 72 characters for consistency

Closes #issue
